- make M4 dict.m4 macro to work with divert() builtin http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/m4.1.asp
  currently the macro collects all the words ptrs and names into separate macros and then at the end unrolls it.
  (please see BUILD_NAME_TABLE). We need to use divertions instead.

- research how to define words with embeded comma inside. So far I am trying to quote it, but it doesn't work for some reason  s. The best example is "c," word which happen to fail.
