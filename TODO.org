* General Stuff  

** DONE Handle this org mode file so we can use it! (as I am a org mode newbie) :-) :phon:  
* M4 Specific 
** TODO make M4 dict.m4 macro to work with divert() builtin 
   http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/m4.1.asp
   currently the macro collects all the words ptrs and names into separate macros and then at the end unrolls it.
   (please see BUILD_NAME_TABLE). We need to use divertions instead.   
** TODO research how to define words with embeded comma inside 
   ( i know it is stupid but who cares :-).
 
   So far I am trying to quote it, but it doesn't work for some reasons. 
   The best example is "c," word which happen to fail, 
   and also [ and ] (which are lb and rb respectively)
* Forth Specific
** TODO Bootstrap a basic Forth system
** TODO Build a first executable image
** TODO Make a small program to dump out the places where the executable needs to be backpatched. 
   This will be in the form of builidng two versions of the same core FourK, and binary comparisions.
   Please not that we need that for automated backpatching, during saving the image.

* Size considerations
** TODO Think how to make a smallest Linux executable ever,	     :design:
   with proper loading of dynamic symbols, how to do this without ld?
   
   Inspirations: 
   - http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html1
** TODO Think about compressor					     :design:
   Maybe ripit from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAQ =)
** TODO Look at tiny.S
* What we don't know yet
  and what we do against that "not knowing"

  DEADLINE: <2009-11-30 Mon>

    for it -- phon
