* General Stuff  
** DONE Handle this org mode file so we can use it! (as I am a org mode newbie) :-) :phon:  
* M4 Specific 
** TODO make M4 dict.m4 macro to work with divert() builtin 
   http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/m4.1.asp
   currently the macro collects all the words ptrs and names into separate macros and then at the end unrolls it.
   (please see BUILD_NAME_TABLE). We need to use divertions instead.   
* Forth Specific
** TODO research how to define words with embeded comma inside	       :phon:
   SCHEDULED: <2009-09-23 Mit>
   ( i know it is stupid but who cares :-).
   So far I am trying to quote it, but it doesn't work for some reasons. 
   The best example is "c," word which happen to fail, 
   and also [ and ] (which are lb and rb respectively)
** DONE Bootstrap a basic Forth system				       :spec:
   The basic funcionality only that allows us to extend. 
   Including: compile/interpret state, immediate words, postpone, creation of words. 
** DONE Build a first executable image				       :spec:
   Only dumping to executable done, via save-image core word. No postprocessing or loading. 
** DONE Very simple load/execution of a saved image		       :spec:
   Done by ovewriting the actual image with a new one. 
   Requirment of having some code not loaded dynamically, especially symbols from
   dlls that are accessed directly (not through plt) (problem with the `stdin' variable).

** TODO Make a small program to dump out the places where the executable needs to be backpatched. 
  This will be in the form of builidng two versions of the same core FourK, and binary comparisions.
  Please not that we need that for automated backpatching, during saving the image.

** TODO Add more Forth words that cover basic stuff
   We need some basic functionality in place, need some more core words, and more FourK
   define words
** TODO Split code into physical sections, polish loader
** TODO Loading imports
   Please see the design section. (What we don't know yet)
** TODO Different flavours of literals
   Byte signed, unsigned, dword. float?. Resolved at compile time.
** TODO Floating point stack
* Size considerations
** TODO Think how to make a smallest Linux executable ever,	     :design:
   with proper loading of dynamic symbols, how to do this without ld?
   
   Inspirations: 
   - http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html1
** TODO Think about compressor					     :design:
   Maybe ripit from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAQ =)
** TODO Look at tiny.S
* What we don't know yet
  and what we do against that "not knowing"

** TODO fourk2 -> png, grayscale converter 			       :phon:
   SCHEDULED: <2009-09-24 Don>
   I'm just interested into how this kind of
   code looks like as a PNG image, to get a feeling
   if that looks like random data or something with
   a structure. I think it will look like something
   structured, which means we could atleast theoretically
   some form-finding compression algorithmens do it's
   magic.
