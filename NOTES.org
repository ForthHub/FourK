This file is for all the knowledge 
about the project, which could get
forgotten:


* registers
** %ebx - parameter stack
   pointer to the parameter stack
** %esi - bytecode instruction pointer
* variables
** state - 0 - compilation, 1 - interpretation. Reverted then in ANS Forth. Subject to change.
* dictionary
** word byte header 
   I am not sure if it wasn't simplier to have just length of the word. (subject to change)
***  byte size - core word (assembly); 
*** -1 - bytecode word;

** special tokens
*** (-1) - end word and return; serves as a word delimiter
*** ( 2) - execute token - must be 1
*** ( 1) - compile token - must be 2
** prefix tokens
*** (0) `lit' - byte literal, get next byte from bytcode and push it on the stacke sign
*** `branch', `branch0' - get next byte, extend the sign and skip n (could be negative) tokens
